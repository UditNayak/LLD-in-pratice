## The Functionality-First Approach
When designing a system, the best way to start is by focusing on the **actions** or **functions** it needs to perform, not the data it will hold.

Think of it like building a car. You don't start by gathering all the raw materials—steel, plastic, rubber—and then try to figure out what to do with them. Instead, you start with the car's **purpose** and **functions**:
- It need to **move** forward and backward.
- It needs to **steer**.
- It needs to **stop**.
- It needs to **carry passengers**.

By focusing on these functions, you can then figure out what components (the **nouns** or entities) are required to fulfill them:
- To **move**, you need an engine and wheels.
- To **steer**, you need a steering wheel and axles.
- To **stop**, you need brakes.
- To **carry passengers**, you need seats and a cabin.

This **functionality-first** approach ensures your design is focused on solving the problem and that every component you create has a clear purpose. It prevents you from creating unnecessary complexity and helps you build a system that is logical and easy to understand.
